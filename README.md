# Represent API: Imago Proxy

[Represent](https://represent.opennorth.ca/) is the open database of Canadian elected officials and electoral districts. It provides a [REST API](https://represent.opennorth.ca/api/) to boundary, representative, and postcode resources.

This repository proxies Imago APIs with elected officials' contact information and reformats the data for import into Represent.
